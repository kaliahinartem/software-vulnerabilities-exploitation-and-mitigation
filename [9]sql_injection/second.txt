The attacker should give the username query such as we finish username string with parentheses " and then we give any true statement for SQL to return $result, where number of rows is more than 0, and we comment everything else with double hyphen to skip password check. In fact, this type of query should return the whole table.
Eventually, query will look like this:

$conn->query("SELECT * from users where username == \"" OR 0 = 0--\" and password == 􏰀→ \"$password\"");
